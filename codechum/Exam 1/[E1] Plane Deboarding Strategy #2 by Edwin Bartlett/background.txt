Introduction
Ever notice how inefficient deboarding a plane can be? This comes down to a single bottleneck: the aisle. While getting off a plane might seem simple, the process is a complex puzzle involving people, luggage, and a single exit path. Passengers in window seats must wait for those in middle and aisle seats to retrieve their belongings and exit first, creating a domino effect of delays.

 

A 2014 Northwestern study found that structured strategies could reduce deboarding time by over 35%. They are designed to minimize these wait times and bottlenecks, getting the aircraft ready for its next flight much faster. Your task today is to simulate a deboarding algorithm using the Array Stack data structure.

 

Your Task
Create the following helper functions in helpers.c for each version of Array Stack. You must complete this so that the Boarding Lists will be initialized properly in main. (NOTE: getting this correctly will already give you half the points!)
void initializeStack_v1(Group* g);
bool isFull_v1(Group* g);
bool isEmpty_v1(Group* g);
void push_v1(Group* g, char* value);
void pop_v1(Group* g);
void initializeStack_v2(Group* g);
bool isFull_v2(Group* g);
bool isEmpty_v2(Group* g);
void push_v2(Group* g, char* value);
void pop_v2(Group* g);
Create function void deplanePassengers(BoardingList* list); in deplane.c - This will contain the logic for the deboarding algorithm described below.
 

Deboarding algorithm
The aircraft has two groups of three seats per row.
Group ABC uses Array Stack v1 (bottom is A) while group DEF uses Array Stack v2 (bottom is F).
Passengers are deplaned in batches. Each batch must consist of groups of seats that are at least two rows apart, with only one group per row.
Begin with the left group in row 1 by popping all passengers from the group.
The next group will be from the opposite side of the aircraft (right side).
This alternating pattern (left, then right) continues, moving down the rows. If a group on the opposite side is empty, proceed to the group on the same side as the previous non-empty group, then resume the alternating pattern.
This process continues until all passengers have been deplaned and all rows have been checked.
